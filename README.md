# 🔍 Regex Matching Web Application (Flask)

A lightweight **Flask-based web application** that replicates the **core functionality of regex101.com**.  
This project allows users to input a **test string** and a **regular expression**, then displays **all matching substrings** using Python’s regex engine.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to:
- Understand how **regular expressions** work internally
- Apply regex logic in a **real-world web application**
- Handle **user-driven inputs** safely
- Build a minimal yet functional **developer utility**

---

## ⚙️ Application Workflow

1. User enters a **test string**
2. User provides a **regular expression**
3. On clicking **Submit**, the backend evaluates the regex against the input
4. All matching substrings are extracted and displayed
5. Invalid regex patterns are handled gracefully

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Regex Engine:** Python `re` module
- **Frontend:** HTML + Jinja2 Templates
- **Form Handling:** POST requests
- **Error Handling:** `re.error` exception handling
